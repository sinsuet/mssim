  "reasoning_summary": "Because Battery is at X=13.00 and Rib is at X=10.0, the current gap is 3.00mm — exactly at the minimum allowed 3.0mm threshold and flagged as GEOMETRY_CLASH due to numerical tolerance violation. Moving Battery in the -X direction would reduce the gap further (worsening clash), so we must move it in +X direction to increase clearance. Prior attempts moved +X up to +5.0mm safely; extending search beyond that (e.g., +5.0 to +10.0mm) provides margin while respecting constraint rules allowing only MOVE."
