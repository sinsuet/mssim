  "reasoning_summary": "Gap to Rib is 1.9999mm, below required 3.0mm clearance; Rib is at X=10.0 and Battery is at X=8.00, so moving Battery in +X direction increases gap. Previous MOVE X [0.0, 3.0] yielded zero delta — likely due to overly conservative upper bound or solver stuck; widen upper bound to ensure sufficient clearance margin while staying within feasible envelope."
